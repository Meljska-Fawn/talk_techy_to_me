# Talk Techy to Me: Tech Blog

## Description

This is a CMS-style blog site where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developers' posts. It uses Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.

## Installation

To install this project, clone the repository from GitHub and open it in your own IDE. Within your terminal, run "npm i" to install the dependencies. Then sign in to your mySQL account using mysql -p and "source db/schema.sql" then quit. Next in terminal type "npm run seed". Once this is done, type "npm start" to start the applicaiton.
